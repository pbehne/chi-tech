\section devman4_sec0 General structure of meshes

Mesh generation can be classified into 4 basic levels difficulty.
-# Orthogonal. The simplest mesh generation is undoubtedly the generation of orthogonal
meshes.
-# Reading meshes. Minimal repackaging of pre-generated meshes.
-# Semi-generated meshes. Extruded meshes and other similar operations.
-# Internally generated meshes. Pipe dream for now, but having the ability
   to generate tetrahedral meshes would open a lot of doors. From there
   I would like to have polyhedral meshes generation then hexahedral mesh
   generation.

\subsection devman_meshes_sec0_0 What is the grid?

The grid is an instance of the chi_mesh::MeshContinuum class. It has 3
members of primary interest namely:
- chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::vertices containing pointers to all the nodes of type
  chi_mesh::Node. The container is an indexed map using vertex global ids.
- chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::local_cells containing local cells of type
  chi_mesh::Cell. The container has an iterator available and is indexed by
  cell local index.
- chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::cells handles indexing by global cell ids. This
  also facilitates the addition of cells to the local_cell storage.

\subsection devman_meshes_sec0_1 Easily access an existing grid

We will explain the different elements of a mesh in more detail in sections
below but as a quick primer we can say that mesh entities are loaded into
chi_mesh::MeshHandler.

You can get the current mesh-handler using:

 \code
    auto cur_handler = chi_mesh::GetCurrentHandler();
 \endcode

The computational grid is contained in a chi_mesh::MeshContinuum object which
you can obtain with:

\code
auto grid = cur_handler->GetGrid();
\endcode

If there is no existing grid then one can be created as detailed in

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_0 chi_mesh::MeshHandler
Meshes and mesh operations are all handled under the umbrella of a
chi_mesh::MeshHandler. Mesh handlers are loaded onto the global variable
`chi_meshhandler_stack` and the "current" handler is tracked by
another global variable, `chi_current_mesh_handler`.
 If any mesh operation is performed it should push
newly created objects to a stack in a handler. The figure below shows
a generalized architecture.

Even though we already showed how to obtain the handler, the "current"
 handler can always be obtained with:

 \code
    auto cur_handler = chi_mesh::GetCurrentHandler();
 \endcode

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_1 chi_mesh::Region

When loading mesh related entities, all mesh operations are pushed onto stacks
contained in the current handler. This is used free-form and the user can
upload as many mesh-related items as he/she desires. When specific mesh items
are specific to a computational grid another grouping element is applied called
a region (chi_mesh::Region). Boundaries are normally attached to regions to
assist in meshing operations, although an empty boundary can also be added.

To create and access grids at least one region must be present on a mesh-handler.

\code
auto cur_region = new chi_mesh::Region();
cur_handler->region_stack.push_back(cur_region);
\endcode

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_2 chi_mesh::SurfaceMesher and chi_mesh::VolumeMesher

Each mesh-handler is outfitted with one surface mesher and one volume
mesher, both initially undefined. The surface meshing step can be thought of
a preprocessing step. For those who are used to STAR-CCM+, this step is
analogous to the remeshing of a CAD surface into a format more conducive to
volume meshing.

There are various types of surface meshers:
 - chi_mesh::SurfaceMesherPredefined. Pass through pre-processor. Does not
   perform any meshing.
 - chi_mesh::SurfaceMesherDelaunay. Remeshes a surface mesh using Delaunay
   triangulation.
 - chi_mesh::SurfaceMesherTriangle. Remeshes a surface mesh using Triangle 1.6.

Similarly there are also various types of volume meshers:
 - chi_mesh::VolumeMesherLinemesh1D. Converts line meshes into slabs.
 - chi_mesh::VolumeMesherPredefined2D. Converts predefined surface meshes into
   2D triangles, quadrilaterals or polygons.
 - chi_mesh::VolumeMesherExtruder. Extrudes predefined surface meshes into
   3D triangular prisms, hexahedrals or polyhedrons.
 - chi_mesh::VolumeMesherPredefined3D. Converts loaded 3D meshes to
   3D tetrahedrals, hexahedrals or polyhedrons.
 - chi_mesh::VolumeMesherPredefinedUnpartitioned. Converts a ligthweight
   unpartitioned mesh to a proper full detail partitioned mesh. This mesher
   allows much flexibility for reading meshes from external sources.

Surface meshers and volume meshers are assigned to a handler as:

\code
cur_handler->surface_mesher = new chi_mesh::SurfaceMesherPredefined;
cur_handler->volume_mesher = new chi_mesh::VolumeMesherPredefined3D;
\endcode

To execute the surface meshers simply do:

\code
cur_handler->surface_mesher->Execute();
cur_handler->volume_mesher->Execute();
\endcode

## _

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_3 chi_mesh::MeshContinuum (or if you like ... THE GRID!)

A chi_mesh::MeshContinuum object is the business-end of meshes. The execution
of a volume mesher ultimately results in the creation of a grid. To obtain
a reference to a grid simply execute:

\code
auto grid = cur_handler->GetGrid();
\endcode

This command will retrieve the latest grid from the latest region within the
current mesh handler.

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_4 chi_mesh::Cell

Cells in Chi-Tech are the basic building blocks for mesh-based scientific
computing. Some of the mesh types are shown in Figure 2 below and are defined
by the enumeration they hold as defined by chi_mesh::CellType. The cell types
supported right now are:
 - chi_mesh::CellType::SLAB
 - chi_mesh::CellType::TRIANGLE
 - chi_mesh::CellType::QUADRILATERAL
 - chi_mesh::CellType::POLYGON
 - chi_mesh::CellType::TETRAHEDRON
 - chi_mesh::CellType::HEXAHEDRON
 - chi_mesh::CellType::POLYHEDRON

\subsection devman_meshes_sec1_5 Accessing cells (the pain of parallel programs)

Cells live in the `local_cells` member of a grid, which is of object type
chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::LocalCells, under the auspices of either
`native_cells` or `foreign_cells`. Local cells are guaranteed to be fully
defined (i.e. not ghost cells) whilst non-local cells are most likely to be
ghost-cells. The fastest way to access a cell is by means of its local id

\code
auto cell = grid->local_cells[cell_local_id];
\endcode

The `local_cells` object also facilitates an iterator.

\code
for (auto cell = grid->local_cells.begin();
     cell != grid->local-cells.end();
     ++cell)
{//do stuff}
\endcode

and also a range based iterator

\code
for (auto& cell : grid->local_cells)
{ //do stuff}
\endcode

Alternatively, a more expensive way to access a cell is by means of its
global index via the grid's `cells` member. This member is a utility object
that will search the `native_cells` and `foreign_cells` for the cell with
the associated global id

\code
auto cell = grid->cells[cell_global_id];
\endcode

Because of the search operation it is not recommended to repeatedly access
cells by their global ids.
